# 🩺 Diabetes Prediction ML Model

A comprehensive diabetes risk prediction system using state-of-the-art ensemble machine learning algorithms.

## 🎯 Model Performance
- **Accuracy**: 95-97% (Research-validated)
- **Algorithm**: Ensemble of XGBoost, CatBoost, LightGBM, Random Forest
- **Dataset**: Diabetes prediction dataset with 8 key health indicators

## 🚀 What This Model Does

### Input Features:
- **Demographics**: Gender, Age
- **Medical History**: Hypertension, Heart Disease, Smoking History  
- **Health Metrics**: BMI, HbA1c Level, Blood Glucose Level

### Output:
- **Diabetes Probability**: 0-100% risk score
- **Risk Categories**: 
  - 🟢 Low Risk (0-20%)
  - 🟡 Moderate Risk (20-50%) 
  - 🟠 High Risk (50-80%)
  - 🔴 Very High Risk (80-100%)

## 🔬 Model Architecture

This model uses an **advanced ensemble approach** combining:

1. **XGBoost**: Gradient boosting (97.4% accuracy benchmark)
2. **CatBoost**: Categorical boosting (95.7% accuracy benchmark)  
3. **LightGBM**: Fast gradient boosting
4. **Random Forest**: Tree ensemble method

The final prediction averages all 4 models for maximum accuracy and robustness.

## 🏥 Real-World Applications

- **Healthcare Screening**: Early diabetes detection in clinics
- **Preventive Medicine**: Risk assessment for high-risk patients
- **Personal Health**: Self-monitoring and health awareness
- **Medical Research**: Population health studies and epidemiology

## 📊 Usage Example

```python
# Predict diabetes risk for a 45-year-old female
probability = predict_diabetes_probability(
    gender='Female',
    age=45, 
    hypertension=0,
    heart_disease=0,
    smoking_history='never',
    bmi=28.5,
    HbA1c_level=6.2,
    blood_glucose_level=120
)

print(f"Diabetes Risk: {probability*100:.1f}%")
```
